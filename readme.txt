== Description ==

This plugin is designed to easily enter a text in a widget for a specific user without the need to enter the admin screen.

At activation of a Grannys Corner widget, a title can be entered and a username selected. 
When the user that 'owns' the widget is logged in, the text area is editable for him/her.
When he presses the save button, he will see the final result. 
If he/she wants to change the content, the page needs to be re-opened by the logged in user.
Multiple instances of the widget can be activated and owned by different users.
The plugin can be translated. Dutch language files are included.
The plugin supports qTranslate.

== Installation ==

You can install the plugin from the WP Admin Plugins page, or manually.
