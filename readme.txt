== Description ==

This plugin is designed to easily enter a text in a widget for a specific user without the need to enter the admin screen.

At activation of a Grannys Corner widget, a title can be entered and a username selected. 
When the user that 'owns' the widget is logged in, the text area is editable for him/her.
When he presses the save button, he will see the final result. 
If he/she wants to change the content, the page needs to be re-opened by the logged in user.
Multiple instances of the widget can be activated and owned by different users.
The plugin can be translated. Dutch language files are included.
